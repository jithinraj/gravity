# Terraform Provider (OSS)

The gravity terraform provider is used to support terraform management of opensource gravity clusters. The provider needs to be configured with a valid token in order to manage a cluster.

## Getting Started

### Install the Gravity provider
The terraform provider will be automatically installed when getting the gravity tools.

```bsh
curl https://get.gravitational.io/telekube/install/5.2.0 | bash
```

Please see the [getting started guide](https://gravitational.com/telekube/docs/quickstart/#getting-the-tools) for more information.

### Example Usage

```bsh
# Configure the Gravity provider
provider "gravity" {
    host  = "https://example.com"
    token = "abcdefghi"
}

# Create a log forwarder
resource "gravity_log_forwarder" "logs" {
    # ...
}
```

### Authentication
The terraform provider uses token based authentication which must be provisioned to the cluster before being used.
